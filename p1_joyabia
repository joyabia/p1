	<h2> About Me</h2>
	<p> I have 10+ years experience working in information technology roles. The bulk of my experience has been in server operating system and recently in application delivery. Due to my experience deploying applications, I developed a curiosity for appplication and software development.
	</p> 
	<p>I am also taking the course on cloud computing E-90 as I have read about rapid application deployment using the cloud and development stacks</p>
	<p>  I plan on applying to the Graduate Information Technology program and this course fulfils the 3 course requirement. </p>
	<p></p>
	<h2> Why I am taking this course</h2>
	<p>I took introduction to web development CSCI E-12 in the spring semester and I enjoyed it so much. Since this course
	is a progression from E-12 I decided to take it. I want to learn all about the application development workflow and server end programming</p> 

	<h2> What Platform Do You Use</h2>
	<p> I am workin on a PC platform</p>
